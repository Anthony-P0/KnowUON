                    <h2>What a Typical Semester Feels and Looks Like?</h2>
                    <p>
                        The first semester as a new student can cause you to feel many different emotions. You might feel excited about 
                        starting something new and at the same time could feel overwhelmed towards the same prospect. As a new student
                        the semester can feel daunting as it can look like there will be a lot of work involved, but it can also be
                        refreshing as the semester looks like a new challenge and change.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Starting a new semester can feel like it moves too fast or even slow which can cause frustration and anxiety 
                        as you think university is boring or too much to handle, leading to stress. But if you manage to get through 
                        the first few weeks of the semester, you will find yourself in a routine without all that stress. 
                           The start of a new semester can bring positive thoughts and emotions too. For example, learning new information 
                        about your area of study can make you feel a keen desire to learn and strive to succeed. And with this desire to
                        learn you can feel like university is where you want to be.
