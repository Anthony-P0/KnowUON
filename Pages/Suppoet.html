            <p>The university will help you no matter what problems you encounter. The school will help you in all aspects for the
                freshmen who have just started. If you need academic support, the school will provide you with online or offline one-to-one pass courses to solve your
                problems effectively. If you need technical support, the school provides students with computers, scanners, laboratories, etc. If you need to consult about
                health or employment, the school will provide you with related services. In addition, a dedicated team of consultants will provide necessary
                assistance to international students. </p>

                            The library is the most frequented place for students. The school provides offline and online
                            resources for students. Students can borrow books for free or search for e-journals or e-books
                            with their student IDs. The library will also provide students with learning space for students
                            to use, and online library support will be provided for remote student libraries.

                            The Peer Assisted Learning Course (PASS) provides a platform for you to compare notes with other
                            students, discuss difficult concepts, and review weekly materials. PASS is sometimes hosted by the
                            outstanding graduates of the previous year. Compared with the instructor, it will understand the
                            doubts of the students.

                            For newly enrolled students, they often encounter problems with the use of some school websites. If you encounter IT
