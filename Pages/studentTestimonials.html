                    <p>Starting university can be intimidating, stressful and overwhelming. No matter how prepared you are for your upcoming 
                        studies you will encounter obstacles and challenges that may make you doubt yourself and your abilities. Perhaps you 
                        realised you don’t like the degree you’re studying or maybe you’re having a little trouble keeping up with the lectures. 
                        This page is not meant to help you make decisions or change your mind about anything but provide a little perspective from 
                        students who have been where you are. The following are student testimonials from the University of Newcastle.

                            I started university in semester 2 of 2016 as a Secondary Education student. I quickly learned that if I wanted to be 
                            a cooking teacher, I would also have to learn construction related courses, so I switched to Primary Education for 1.5 years. 
                            When I joined, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information and expectations that was thrown at you within the first week. 
                            After a couple weeks I made some friends and got into the flow of university work. Once I completed my work experience, 
                            I learned that I did not want to be a primary education teacher, and I transferred into the Bachelor of Information Technology. 
                            I went in with the goal of learning web development, which I did, this website being an example haha, but I also found I really 
                            enjoyed programming, I’ve learned how to program in C#, Java, learning C++ and have grown many more talents. My advice to new 
                            students would be to not be scared if you find the subject, you’re learning to not be the right one, there’s nothing wrong in 
                            switching into something else. Keeping up to date with assignments can get difficult, but if you keep a routine, you’ll do fine.

                            I have been attending the University Of Newcastle since 2012. Initially I was in the Bachelor Of Science program majoring Earth Sciences, however whilst 
                            I enjoyed earth sciences my first couple of years were rough. I think I underestimated the transition to university and while I felt like I was prepared
                            the results were saying otherwise. I had trouble passing course, but I did do INFT1001 as elective where I achieved a distinction. In 2015 after my difficulties
                            I made the switch to Information Technology majoring interactive media. Results were still mixed the first couple of semesters, but I did achieve a high distinction in foundations of media
                            production. By 2016 I finally felt like I was finding my feet with consistent results and I have enjoyed learning different aspects from media production,
                            web development, game design, game production and so on. My focus since commencing my studies has always been academic, but I have met a lot people from different backgrounds
                            and disciplines through the various group related work I have done. If I could go back in time to 2012 and had an opportunity to start over I would take more care of my preparation
                            and making sure what I'm studying is the right fit for me. My advice to new students besides preparation and keeping up to date with courese developments would be don't be afraid to ask for help whether it's from your lecturers,
                            tutors, PASS leaders etc. I am convinced much of my early difficulties were because I didn't approach the right people when I needed help. It's understandable for it to be daunting
                            at first, but once you get over that hurdle you'll feel relieved.

                            I am an international student and I will be studying a data science course at Newcastle University starting in 2020. I started a university course in another country
                            and then transferred to the Newcastle course. At first, my major was artificial intelligence. This is a course under computer science, including
                            some artificial intelligence algorithms, computer systems, and network security. And software engineering and other courses. The course almost
                            covers many complex aspects of computer science. In the first year of university, Idid have a very difficult semester, and I was very unsuited to
                            the university learning environment. For example, in middle school education, we only need to follow the teacher's hand-in-hand instruction to
                            complete learning tasks, but not in college. When I first went to university, the teacher had a lot of content in every class. The teacher
                            usually provided us with learning materials and learning methods. We need to do it ourselves. In this process, I often encountered many problems,
                            which was very difficult at one time. Later, in the communication with the teachers, I learned about some course teams that might be helpful to
                            me, especially the Pass course and our lab teachers. They usually organize a pass course once a week to help us, or lab tutors will In the lab
                            every week, I can ask him for help. My suggestion is that every freshman is best to actively communicate with the tutors and classmates in the
                            university when they enter the school, so that they can get a lot of experience and help in solving problems. Finally, as an international student,
                            you will encounter more problems than others, but don't be afraid to communicate with classmates and teachers, I believe they are very happy to
                            communicate with international students or provide help. Although we may be the most proficient in languages and customs, once international
                            students integrate into school life, they will have more fun and friends.

                            I began my Bachelor of Information Technology degree at the University of Newcastle (UON) in 2015 
                            as a part time student. As a student with a physical disability, I thought studying at university 
                            wasn’t going to be a possibility and be too much of a challenge for my abilities, but accessing helpful 
                            resources made this a possibility and a challenge I knew I could overcome in order to succeed. Besides my 
                            personal challenges I assumed that continuing my education straight after completion of secondary education 
                            would be exhausting and repetitive. However, after my first few weeks of classes I discovered that studying 
                            at UON was refreshing as I not only learnt upon what I knew but new skills and information in different ways. 
                            Over the 7 years spent culminating all these skills and information, it allowed myself to use them to design 
                            and build a website for a cable terminations company enabling myself to gain real world experience.
