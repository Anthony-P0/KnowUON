                    <p>Starting university can be intimidating, stressful and overwhelming. No matter how prepared you are for your upcoming 
                        studies you will encounter obstacles and challenges that may make you doubt yourself and your abilities. Perhaps you 
                        realised you don’t like the degree you’re studying or maybe you’re having a little trouble keeping up with the lectures. 
                        This page is not meant to help you make decisions or change your mind about anything but provide a little perspective from 
                        students who have been where you are. The following are student testimonials from the University of Newcastle.
                    </p>

                            I started university in semester 2 of 2016 as a Secondary Education student. I quickly learned that if I wanted to be 
                            a cooking teacher, I would also have to learn construction related courses, so I switched to Primary Education for 1.5 years. 
                            When I joined, I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information and expectations that was thrown at you within the first week. 
                            After a couple weeks I made some friends and got into the flow of university work. Once I completed my work experience, 
                            I learned that I did not want to be a primary education teacher, and I transferred into the Bachelor of Information Technology. 
                            I went in with the goal of learning web development, which I did, this website being an example haha, but I also found I really 
                            enjoyed programming, I’ve learned how to program in C#, Java, learning C++ and have grown many more talents. My advice to new 
                            students would be to not be scared if you find the subject, you’re learning to not be the right one, there’s nothing wrong in 
                            switching into something else. Keeping up to date with assignments can get difficult, but if you keep a routine, you’ll do fine.
